## üöÄ Overview

CardioInsight AI is a professional-grade machine learning application for cardiovascular risk assessment. Using advanced Random Forest algorithms and explainable AI techniques, it provides accurate predictions and detailed insights into heart disease risk factors.

The application features a comprehensive dashboard with:
- Patient data input interface
- Real-time risk assessment with probability scores
- Professional medical report generation
- Feature importance analysis using SHAP values
- Radar chart visualization for patient profiling

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Heart-Disease-Detection.git
   cd Heart-Disease-Detection
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows:
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üìä Data

The raw dataset (`heart.csv`) is not included in the repository due to its size and to adhere to Git best practices.

### To obtain the data:
1. Download the dataset from [Kaggle Heart Disease UCI](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)
2. Place the downloaded `heart.csv` file into the `data/raw/` directory

| cp | Chest pain type |
| trestbps | Resting blood pressure (mm Hg) |
| chol | Serum cholesterol (mg/dl) |
| fbs | Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false) |
| restecg | Resting electrocardiographic results |
| thalach | Maximum heart rate achieved |
| exang | Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no) |
| oldpeak | ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest |
