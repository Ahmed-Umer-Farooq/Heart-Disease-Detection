# Heart Disease Detection Project

## üöÄ Overview
This project focuses on predicting heart disease using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, model training (e.g., Random Forest Classifier), and a simple application for inference.

## ‚ú® Features
*   **Data Preprocessing:** Scripts in `src/utils/data_processing.py` (if you have one) for handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.
*   **Model Training:** Training script for a Random Forest Classifier.
*   **Prediction Application:** `app.py` provides a basic interface for making predictions.
*   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Jupyter notebook (`notebooks/heart_disease.ipynb`) for data exploration and visualization.
*   **Utility Functions:** Reusable functions for charts, explanations, and reporting in `src/utils/`.

## üìÅ Project Structure


## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Heart-Disease-Detection.git
    cd Heart-Disease-Detection
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## üìä Data
The raw dataset (`heart.csv`) is not included in the repository due to its size/nature and to adhere to Git best practices.
*   **To obtain the data:** **[IMPORTANT: SPECIFY HOW TO GET YOUR `heart.csv` DATA HERE.]**
    *   **Example 1 (Download from a public link):** Download `heart.csv` directly from Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/your-dataset-link-here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/your-dataset-link-here)
    *   **Example 2 (Contact author for private data):** Please contact [Your Email Address or GitHub Profile Link] if you require access for educational or research purposes.
    *   **Example 3 (Generated by script):** The data is generated by running `python scripts/data_preparation.py` (if you have a script for this).
*   **Place the data file:** Save the downloaded or generated `heart.csv` into the `data/raw/` directory.

## üèÉ Usage
Here's how to run the main components of this project:

*   **To run the main prediction application:**
    (Ensure your virtual environment is activated and data is in `data/raw/`)
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    (Add any specific instructions for `app.py` if it requires arguments or special setup)

*   **To explore the data and models using the Jupyter Notebook:**
    (Ensure your virtual environment is activated)
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Then, navigate to `notebooks/heart_disease.ipynb` in your web browser. Run all cells to see the analysis and training process.

*   **(Optional) To retrain the model:**
    (If you have a separate training script, e.g., `train.py` in `src/`):
    ```bash
    python src/train.py
    ```
    (Add specific instructions for training if applicable)
